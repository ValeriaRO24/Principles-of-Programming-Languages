-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- * Note about type signatures
--
-- Unlike Racket, Haskell is /statically-typed/. We'll go into more detail about
-- what this means later in the course, but for now we've provided type signatures
-- for the functions here to simplify any compiler error messages you might
-- receive. (Don't change them; they're required to compile against our tests.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | Replace every instance of a number in a list with a second number
replaceAll :: [Int] -> Int -> Int -> [Int]
replaceAll lst id with = replaceAllHelper lst id with []      -- TODO: REPLACE ME

-- | Helper function for replaceAll
replaceAllHelper :: [Int] -> Int -> Int -> [Int] -> [Int]
replaceAllHelper (x:xs) id with acc = if x == id then replaceAllHelper xs id with (with:acc) else replaceAllHelper xs id with (x:acc)-- TODO: REPLACE ME
replaceAllHelper [] id with acc = reverse acc


-- | The simplest "property-based test" is simply a unit test; note the type.
prop_replaceAllSingle :: Bool
prop_replaceAllSingle = (replaceAll [0, 1, 2, 3] 0 1) == [1, 1, 2, 3]

prop_replaceAll :: [Int] -> Bool
prop_replaceAll lst = not (elem 1 (replaceAll lst 1 2))

-- You may wish write additional simple unit tests like prop_replaceAllSingle 
-- Add the tests you wrote to the end of this file, in the `main` block
-- to actually run those tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- * Main function (for testing purposes only)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- This main function is executed when you compile and run this Haskell file.
-- It runs the QuickCheck tests; we'll talk about "do" notation much later in
-- the course, but for now if you want to add your own tests, just define them
-- above, and add a new `quickCheck` line below.
